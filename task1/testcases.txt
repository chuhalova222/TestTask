Test design technics were used:

Boundary value analysis:
Boundary value analysis technic was used for verifying phone number length and phone number prefix length
There are test cases
when we enter 10 numbers that is incorrect,
when we use 9 numbers and correct password and login is successful,
when we use 1 correct number for phone code and prefix error is presented,
when we use 2 correct numbers for phone code and prefix error isn't presented

Equivalence partitioning:
Equivalence partitioning was used for verifying correct and incorrect phone number and password values
There are test cases
when we enter correct or incorrect password,
when we enter correct or incorrect phone number

Error guessing:
Error guessing was used for verifying user errors like invalid characters in phone number form or invalid country code

State transition testing:
State transition testing was used for testing transitions like redirecting to forgot password page or registration page.

Pairwise testing:
Pairwise testing was used when we test different errors for phone number and password
and in some cases test clicking out of the form
and in some cases entering another field correctly and clicking logic button after that
